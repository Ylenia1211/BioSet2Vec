# BioSet2Vec

**BioSet2Vec** is a tool designed to extract k-mer dictionaries from multiple sets of biological sequences using distributed computing. This method is efficient for large-scale biological sequence analysis, enabling users to handle diverse sequence sets, such as DNA sequences, and extract k-mer representations in a distributed fashion. The extracted k-mer dictionaries can be used for downstream tasks like sequence comparison, feature extraction, and machine learning.

## Features

- **Distributed k-mer extraction**: Handles multiple biological sequence sets.
- **Scalability**: Optimized for large datasets using distributed computation.
- **Flexible k-mer size**: Adjustable k-mer lengths to suit the userâ€™s specific needs.
- **Support for various biological sequences**: Compatible with DNA sequences.
- **Efficient I/O handling**: Works with large files in FASTA, FASTQ, or other common biological sequence formats.
